## Introduction

Student dropout rates are a significant challenge for educational institutions, affecting both reputation and financial stability. This project helps an edutech company predict student dropout risks, enabling early intervention to improve retention and student success.

---

## Problems Addressed

- **High Dropout Rates:** Impacting institutional performance and reputation.
- **Late Detection:** The absence of early warning mechanisms to identify at-risk students.
- **Limited Insights:** Inadequate understanding of the factors that contribute to student attrition.

---

## Project Scope

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Training predictive models to assess dropout risk.
- **Deployment with Streamlit:** Creating an interactive app for predictions.
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Building a business dashboard with Looker Studio to display insights and monitor student performance.

---

## Preparation

### Data Source
- [Student Performance Dataset](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/dicoding_dataset/blob/main/students_performance/README.md)

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SAS_ML_Project
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## Dashboard

The business dashboard, built using Looker Studio, provides visual insights into student performance and dropout risks. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify at-risk students and understand the underlying factors.

## Running the Machine Learning System

To run the machine learning prototype:

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Install dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Launch the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Input student data** within the app to receive dropout risk predictions.

---

## Conclusion

The Student Attrition System project successfully develops a machine learning model that predicts student dropout risks with reasonable accuracy. By integrating this model with a Looker Studio dashboard, institutions can gain actionable insights to reduce dropout rates and enhance student retention.

## Recommended Action Items

- **Enhance Academic Support:**  
  Implement tutoring, counseling, and additional resources for students, especially during the early semesters.

- **Improve Financial Flexibility:**  
  Introduce financial aid or flexible payment options to ease tuition fee burdens.

- **Address Academic Gaps:**  
  Offer preparatory courses or additional training for students with lower prior qualifications.

- **Monitor Financial Stress:**  
  Increase support and monitoring for students facing financial difficulties.

- **Expand Scholarship Programs:**  
  Broaden scholarship offerings to support high-risk students.
